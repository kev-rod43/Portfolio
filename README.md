# Portfolio

## Project description 
My Portfolio project was a challenging project where I had to code a functional, single page portfolio utilizing exclusively CSS and HTML. This project is what I would consider my first real project due to the the extensive effort I had to employ, since I chose the path of most resistance, due to me limiting myself to utilizing exclusively css styling to bring some life to my page, and not rely in external images to set a style.

Through completing this projected I gained the following:

•Practice and knowledge on how to read and properly comprehend documentations.

•A better understading on proportionate sizing in CSS and positioning.

•And most importantly, confidence in my patience and problem solving skills.
